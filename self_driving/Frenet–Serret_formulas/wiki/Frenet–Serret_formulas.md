- [Frenet–Serret formulas](#frenetserret-formulas)

In [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), the Frenet–Serret formulas describe the [kinematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic) properties of a particle moving along a continuous, differentiable curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space $R^3$, or the geometric properties of the curve itself irrespective of any motion. More specifically, the formulas describe the derivatives of the so-called **tangent**, **normal**, and **binormal** unit vectors in terms of each other.

The tangent, normal, and binormal unit vectors, often called **T**, **N**, and **B**, or collectively the **Frenet–Serret frame** or **TNB frame**, together form an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis) [spanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_span) $R^3$ and are defined as follows:

- T is the unit vector [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector) to the curve, pointing in the direction of motion.

- N is the normal unit vector, the derivative of T with respect to the arclength parameter of the curve, divided by its length.

- B is the binormal unit vector, the cross product of T and N.
